  # Polymorphism
Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming. Polymorphism is a concept that allows you to perform a
single action in different ways. Polymorphism is the combination of two Greek words. The poly means many, and morphs means forms. So polymorphism
means many forms.

There are two types of polymorphism in C++:

1. Compile time Polymorphism
  a. Function overloading
  b. Operator overloading

2. Run-time polymorphism:
  a. Virtual Function


  # compile time Polymorphism:
Also known as Early binding/static polymorphism.
Compile-time polymorphism is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism can be achieved through function overloading or
operator overloading.

a) Function overloading: When there are multiple functions in a class with the same name but different parameters, these functions are overloaded.
The main advantage of function overloading is that it increases the program’s readability. Functions can be overloaded by using different numbers of
arguments or by using different types of arguments.

b) Operator Overloading: C++ also provides options to overload operators. For example, we can make the operator (‘+’) for the string class to
concatenate two strings. We know that this is the addition operator whose task is to add two operands. When placed between integer operands,
a single operator, ‘+,’ adds them and concatenates them when placed between string operands.
